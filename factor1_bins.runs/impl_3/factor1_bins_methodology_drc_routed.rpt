Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock pll_dac1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin pll_dac1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) PHY_MDIO direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (PHY_MDIO) connected to this Port, but both were not found.

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.462 ns between data_adc_reg[58][3]/C (clocked by ts_clk160) and adc_data_reg[3]/D (clocked by ts_clk125). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

There is a large setup violation of -3.464 ns between data_adc_reg[10][8]/C (clocked by ts_clk160) and adc_data_reg[0]/D (clocked by ts_clk125). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
